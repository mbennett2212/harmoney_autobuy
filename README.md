# Harmoney Autobuy
Harmoney (https://www.harmoney.co.nz/) previously was a P2P lender in New Zealand. This allowed retail investors to invest into loans given to borrowers. Unfortunately they no longer offer the ability for retail investors to invest into loans (hence I make this code public).

This program 'could' be used to periodically poll (at a respectful interval) the currently available loans and invest in them if they passed a given set of requirements. The APIs used are undocumented and discovered by inspecting the network traffic generated by using their web application.
